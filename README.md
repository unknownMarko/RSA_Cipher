# RSA Cipher

![](https://github.com/unknownMarko/RSA_Cipher/blob/main/screenshots/screenshot.png)

The RSA cipher is a widely-used public-key cryptographic algorithm, developed by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman in 1977. It relies on the mathematical difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers to ensure security. RSA employs a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. It is foundational to modern cryptography, enabling secure data transmission, digital signatures, and key exchange over insecure channels.
